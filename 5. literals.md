### Java Literals
A literal is a source code representation of a fixed value. They are represented directly in the code without any computation.

Literals can be assigned to any primitive type variable. For example −

```
byte a = 68;
char a = 'A';
```
byte, int, long, and short can be expressed in decimal(base 10), hexadecimal(base 16) or octal(base 8) number systems as well.

Prefix 0 is used to indicate octal, and prefix 0x indicates hexadecimal when using these number systems for literals. For example −
```
int decimal = 100;
int octal = 0144;
int hexa =  0x64;
```
String literals in Java are specified like they are in most other languages by enclosing a sequence of characters between a pair of double quotes. Examples of string literals are −

Example
```
"Hello World"
"two\nlines"
"\"This is in quotes\""
```
String and char types of literals can contain any Unicode characters. For example −
```
char a = '\u0001';
String a = "\u0001";
```
Java language supports few special escape sequences for String and char literals as well. They are −

| Notation	| Character represented |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| \n |	Newline (0x0a) |
| \r |	Carriage return (0x0d) |
| \f |	Formfeed (0x0c) |
| \b |	Backspace (0x08) |
| \s |	Space (0x20) |
| \t |	tab |
| \" |	Double quote |
| \' |	Single quote |
| \\ |	backslash |
| \ddd |	Octal character (ddd) |
| \uxxxx |	Hexadecimal UNICODE character (xxxx) |
