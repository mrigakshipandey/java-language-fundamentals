There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages âˆ’

| Sr.No. |	Loop & Description |
| ------- | ------- |
| 1 | 	while loop | Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.  |
| 2 | 	for loop | Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable. |
| 3 | 	do...while loop | Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body. |

### Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

Java supports the following control statements. 

| Sr.No. |	Control Statement & Description |
| ------- | ------- |
| 1	| break statement | Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch. |
| 2	| continue statement | Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating. |

### Enhanced for loop in Java
This is mainly used to traverse collection of elements including arrays.
